Single segmentation with file name inputs:
vesselSeg_BH(fn_ins,fn_seg,save_path)
	fn_ins = full path to INSP ct image file
	fn_seg = full path to lobe segmentation
	save_path = where to save results

Single segmentation with matrix inputs:
vesselSeg_BH(img,label,info,save_path)
	img = INSP ct image matrix
	label = lobe segmentation matrix
	info = nifti metadata
	save_path = where to save results

Run batch on Great Lakes (using Turbo storage):
GL_vesselSeg(username,fn_ins_fn_seg,save_path)
	username = your uniquename
	fn_ins = cell array of full paths to INSP image files
	fn_seg = cell array of full paths to corresponding lobe segmentation files
	save_path = string where to save results (will make subdirectories for each subject)
