# Scattering Convolutional Network for Air Trapping Classification and Segmentation in CT Lung Images

## Initial setup

To run the code, you need Matlab with image processing tool box and mex configured correctly (type mex -setup in the matlab prompt).

## Usage

Run demoScatNet.m. This segments areas of air trapping in a single 3D CT Lung image slice-by-slice and writes the result as an image in the same folder where the data is present.
